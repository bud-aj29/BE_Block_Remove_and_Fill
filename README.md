- Last tested 1.20.60
- This behavior pack removes or fills blocks based on which block the player is holding in the main-hand
- Changes in v0.0.8:
  - Renamed manifest file to fix a bug loading in some OS
- It activates when the player uses a bucket in the main-hand. This gives an easy way to turn it off and on in game
- Choose remove/fill type by toggling through options each time a bucket is used
- Holding water buckets, lava buckets, and powder snow buckets remove/fill those block types respectively
